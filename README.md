  ### I'm a 16 year old that loves to program
  <br>I'm currently working on learning as much as I can, 
  whilst also gaining a deeper understanding of those I already know.
  
  While I am, as my repos reflect, primarily a Python programmer for the time being, 
  I am exploring other languages such as C++ and JavaScript.
  
  My longest-running project is a Discord bot called `neo`, which you 
  can check out [here](https://github.com/nickofolas/neo). I also run the
  Reddit bot /u/TheReposterminator. You can check out that project [here](https://github.com/nickofolas/TheReposterminator).

I'm open to commissions for Discord bots, and the best place to contact me for
that would be shooting me a DM @nickofolas#1184 on Discord.
